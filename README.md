# README - Enron Machine Learning Project

## Introduction
This project uses data from the Enron email corpus to identify someone as a **'Person of Interest' (POI)**. 

The dataset provided includes people who were already classified as a **POI** i.e. an individual who was indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal, or testified in exchange for immunity. This project analyzed the data of these POIs (and non-POIs), and came up with a predictive algorithm that could accurately guess whether a new data point with similar features was or was not a POI.

## Installation
The scripts use Python 2.7; ensure that the appropriate environment is selected.

1. Clone my repository and the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning repository using Github Desktop or Terminal.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/meloleo/UDAND-ENRON.git

    $ git clone https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git
    ```

2. Once the repositories are cloned, copy and paste the files in UDAND-ENRON repository into the other repository, specifically the folder "final_project".
3. Run `poi_id.py`.
